Here are the solutions for the 6 195 instances of the BPPLIB.

In "Solutions.xlsx", you can find, for each category of instances (one per sheet): 
- Name of the instance
- Best LB obtained from the exact algorithms (the LB is updated when the algorithm is over or when the time limit is reached)
- Best UB obtained from the exact algorithms (the UB is updated when the algorithm is over or when the time limit is reached)
- Status ("Solved" if LB = UB, "Open" otherwise)
- Comment (for the open ANI and AI instances) gives the expected optimal value 
- Selected (for all but the GI instances): 1 if selected in the experimental results, 0 otherwise (closed by BFDL2).
 
In "Results_VPS" and "Results_BLV", the solutions found by the algorithms BELOV and VPSOLVER are given.
